# CSC133-A1

The goal of this first assignment is to develop a good initial class hierarchy and control structure by designing the program in UML and then implementing it in Codename One (CN1). This version will use keyboard input commands to control and display the contents of a “game world” containing the set of objects in the game. In future assignments, many of the keyboard commands will be replaced by interactive GUI operations, and we will add graphics, animation, and sound.
